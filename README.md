# StopSeeker

Next-bus arrival times for TTC. Because knowing the next bus is "Delayed" is super helpful.

### How to use:
Scan the bus stop; the application will identify the stop ID and display the associated information, including: next three bus arrival times for each route, as well as an indicator of how far ahead/behind schedule each bus is. Information can be filtered to a specific route.
